<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
<p>The sites for <a href="http://www.gmail.com">gmail</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com">apple</a></p>
<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.gmail.com">gmail</a> site has great use of space.  It allows the user to actually choose their own white space and then uses transparent negative space behind the text to make that positive space stand out enough for the user.  The positive space is neat and uniform to let the negative space pop which is uncommon.  The use of balance, on the other hand, is not the best, in my opinion.  There are many different shapes on this page which become visually cumbersome for the viewer.  I also feel like the left column is a little cluttered and there's no clear separation between the folders and the hangout contacts and conversations.
<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.apple.com">apple</a> site also has great use of space, while being very different from the gmail site.  The viewer sees a very simple home page with limited positive space and vast negative space.  The focal point, then, clearly becomes the single product that they choose to highlight at that time.  It also forces the viewer to scroll down to look for more information.  I'm not crazy about the use of size in the heading.  There are too many options at the top and each one is very small which makes the viewer read through more rather than quickly get to the information they're looking for.  I feel like it would be more visually appealing if there were less options and they were a bit bigger to bring the user to them.
</p>
<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
<p>
I like the <a href="http://www.gmail.com">gmail</a> site because most of the information I need is on one page and broken out very clearly with the focus on the inbox which is what I am primarily visiting the site for.  The <a href="http://www.apple.com">apple</a> site has very limited information on that first page.  It's clean looking and further information is available in additional pages which are neatly organized and easy to find.  
<br>
<br>
Both emphasize the content of the page over the branding.  For example, the site logos are not the focal point of either page and size is used to diminish them and move them far down in the hierarchy.
